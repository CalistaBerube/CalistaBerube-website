        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Junior at the University of California, Riverside. Currently, I am working toward my Bachelorâ€™s of Art in Psychology, with a minor in Philosophy. I graduated from Encore High School for the Arts, and have a background in visual and technical arts. I studied film and visual arts for three years, and studied screenwriting for five years. With a background in art, I was accepted into UC Riverside as an Art History major. However, through some of my Freshman classes, I realized a great passion for Psychology and Philosophy that I chose to pursue. I believe that my background in the arts, and now with Philosophy, helps to give me an open minded and creative edge in a field that is built on both science and an open, compassionate mind. I plan to get my Masters in Psychology after receiving my BA. My long term goal is to receive my PhD in Psychology and become a licensed Clinical Psychologist, so I can do my best to improve the livelihood and mental health of those who need it.<br><br>

        A majority of my working experience so far has been interning and volunteering in the Riverside art scene. I volunteered and interned at the Riverside Arts Council for five years, which helped give me insight into how a nonprofit functions, and how to give back to the community through artistic expression. Through this internship, I attended events throughout the Inland Empire, assisted with filing and inventory, social media management, writing descriptions for events, and ran the check-in booth at the Riverside Arts Walk. This also prepared me for my job at Kirklandâ€™s, where I worked for six months as a seller. At Kirklandâ€™s, I engaged in customer service and problem solving constantly, as it was a very engaging and hands on workplace. I also engaged in setting up displays, cleaning, and organizing. A majority of my time there was spent during the busy holiday months, including Black Friday, so I am trained to be efficient and level headed in a fast paced, high stress environment.<br><br>

        Through graduate school, my plan is to start working in the Psychology field as soon as I am qualified. My first step will be internships within the field, so I can gain experience and see what environment I will be most suited to work in. Itâ€™s important to me to work in different environments with different types of patients so I can have a better idea of what direction Iâ€™ll go in. Once I am qualified, I will become a therapist while I am working toward my PhD, which will add significantly to my experience with working with clients, and will be the backbone for my career as a Psychologist. I am passionate and determined in my path through the Psychology field as mental health isnâ€™t taken as seriously as it should be. My minor in Philosophy will help me gain a broader understanding of people and life that will improve my interactions with clients and Psychology as a whole.
